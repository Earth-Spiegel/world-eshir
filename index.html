        <p class="world-lore-text">Accompanied by two planets, floating in space, a spherical rock.</p>
        <p class="world-lore-text">Wrongly accused of being a mistress, Sakurina, the goddess of nature, was stripped of her rank and exiled from the celestial realm. For many eons she had traveled through the infinity of space, finally coming upon the spherical rock. Seeing it reminded her that, her life, no longer had any purpose. Tired and hollowed from the eons of journeying through space, she let her tears flow. Crawling down her snow-white cheeks, dripping from her chin, the tears dropped upon the spherical rock, creating on it craters and cracks, and filling them with water and life. She cried for a long time; her tears, first water, were now streams and droplets of her golden and shining celestial blood. Landing upon the now flooded rock, her bloody tears infused it with magic.</p>
        <p class="world-lore-text">In the few moments before her death, the gods took pity on her and divided her mind, body, and soul. They transformed her mind into the sun, which shone down upon the rock, giving it light; her body, into a gaseous ring surrounding it and, flashing within it, a brilliance of colors; her soul was transformed into the moon, glowing softly in the sky—and thus, Eshir, was created.</p>
        <p class="world-lore-text">Separated by and being molded by it, stood six massive structures of land above the surface of the ocean. These land structures would become known as “The Six Continents of Eshir”. It's surface sprung up with life: trees and plants grew in abundance and animals, starting underground and in the depths of the ocean, evolved and grew, eventually roaming the surface planet on limbs or floating and soaring through the air with magic or wings. Some were able to do both—soaring through the air or diving as far deep into the depths as they wished.

        <h1 id="current-plot-header">The Current Situation in the Six Continents</h1>
        <div id="container-a">
            <p id="current-plot-text" class="make-smaller">Many years after the creation of Eshir, races sprang up, either through evolution or aliens that landed and never left, and also, through the procreation of both. Through civility, they were able to have peace amongst themselves. They traveled the six continents settling where they pleased and building up villages and towns, which eventually turned to cities and kingdoms. Years started and passed, innovations, trade, agriculture, and life boomed within all the continents of Eshir. Mechanics striving for the future, made blueprints, which were spread throughout all the continents and kingdoms within, of "The Blimp". A ship connected to a balloon, powered by gases and protected by magic; Alchemists and scientists worked together to discover different compounds (including the gases used to power the blimps) as well as gather and name all the different creatures living in the land; Explorers took to the ships and oceans to discover unknown lands to map and treasures to loot; Good craftsmen were hired to build temples to the gods and the divines, as well as working with mechanics, scientists, and alchemists to further improve their technologies; Writers, muscians, and artists went with the explorers or traveled the roads, paved and unpaved, to find stories worth writing, scenes worth capturing, and an adventure worth being sung.</p>
            <p id="current-plot-text" class="make-smaller">All seemed well and peaceful. Until the Queen of Alamir, Sydneria passed away from an incurable illness. The King, Trite, fell into depression, and as much as he tried, he could not hide his grief. Realizing he no longer had the energy or motivation to run his kingdom, he passed it onto his eldest son, Prince Trite the II. Prince Trite the II, was a great ruler. Maybe it was due to being the eldest, but he put his kingdom before all else, including his love-life. It wasn't until twenty years after being crowned king, did he marry, and ten years after that, for him to have a heir. As for his father, King Trite, the day after crowning his son king, he passed away in his sleep, leaving a letter telling his son to take care and that if it was his son's, the kingdom was in good hands. Now, the trouble here is that, Prince Trite (or now, King Trite), has a younger brother, Prince Wo. Prince Wo is the youngest, and was also the most spoiled. He had no regards for the burdens that his father bore and thought that being king, meant that he would rule over all with absolute power and do whatever it is that he pleased. But due to being the youngest, he was not the heir, instead it was his goody-two-shoe brother, the love of the kingdom, the one he despised. So he hatched a plan.<br> After the birth of his son, King Trite the II was persuaded by his lovely wife, Queen Angelica, to travel the continents as a vacation as well as a meet-and-greet to the future king. King Trite, agreed - his kingdom and continent were doing well and he had been busy with diplomatic works and courts that he had not taken a break in the past ten years or so - quite some time. So off they went, first visiting cities, towns, and villages within their continent....and unfortunately, they never left. King Trite the II was found murdered in his sleep the third morning. Prince Wo was now crowned king, for his brother's child was not yet old enough, and in addition, he also took Queen Angelica as his wife.</p>
            <p id="current-plot-text" class="make-smaller">The news of his crowning were met with mostly fear and anger, the people of Alamir wondered what the future held in store for them. The rulers of the other continents, sent their condolences but, having met King Wo, some knew that he would not be good for Alamir and others...saw opportunity. Nevirit and Slawgden, prosperous but unfulfilled, individually, began to train and send spies to the other continents to gather info. Alamir, just as they had thought, was training and mustering up an army, for King Wo, was thirsty for power. With this knowledge, Nevirit and Slawgden, started to prepare as well...if the other three continents were left out of the loop than it would just be them: Alamir, Slawgden, and Nevirit, that would be fighting for power, and whoever won, would be able to take over the other unprepared continents as well.</p>
